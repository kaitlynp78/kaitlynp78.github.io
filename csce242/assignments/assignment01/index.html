            <h2>Why I like sloths:</h2>
            <p>
                Sloths are my <b>favorite</b> animal. I like them because I think they're adorable! Sloths are very sweet
                with humans too. I hope to be able to meet one!

            <h2>More about sloths:</h2>
            <p>
                Sloths let moss and algae grow on themselves so that they can camoflouge within their surroundings. So if you ever see 
                green stuff on a sloths fur, thats why! Sloths also mainly come out of their trees simply to use the bathroom! Another
                little unknown fact about sloths is that they can swim. I once saw a documentary that showed a sloth that swam across a 
                large river to reunite with his mate.
